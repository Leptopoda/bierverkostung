# Bierverkostung
This project aims to improve an abandoned [project](https://bitbucket.org/jufickel/bierverkostung).

It will consist of three parts
 - Trinksprüche/Spiele
 - Bierverkostung
 - Konsum Tracking

## Platforms
Currently Supported platforms:
- Android
- iOS/iPadOS
- Web

Regarding Desktop support like Linux or Windows firebase currently does not support those platforms. 
We'll need to wait for this to tackle propper desktop support. MacOS is theoratiacally supported but we'll finalize the implementation with the other desktop support.

## Hosted
This project is already hosted on https://saufen.rimikis.de. Check it out as more features will arrive.

## Translation
The app is translated on https://weblate.rimikis.de/projects/bierverkostung.

## Versioning
For now we use a fairly uncommon versioning scheme. Until 1.0.0 we increment the minor version when work on a big new feature starts and increment accordingly until finished.
We'll switch to a more common versioning system once ready for production.

## Getting Started

### Documentation
A documentation for the project code can be found [here](https://saufen.rimikis.de/doc/api).

### Firebase

We encurage you to setup a local Firebase development enviornment.

Enter the Firebase directory
```
cd firebase
```

Download the necessary tools (npm needed)
```
npm install -g firebase
```

Start the local emulators
```
firebase emulators:start
```

Build the app with the local config pre applied
```
flutter run --dart-define=local_firebase=true
```
Need a custom domain/ip? 
```
flutter run --dart-define=local_firebase_ip=10.0.0.2
```

### Local Testing
Before creating a PR be shure to test your changes!

Use emulators or real devices. Testing the web version can be done like this:
```
flutter build web --release
```
and in the output dir run
```
dhttpd --path=build/web
```
to run the test
```
flutter test
```
